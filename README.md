Predictive Analytics &amp; Machine Learning for Managers - companion site for my book with the same name.
This repository contains two folders, one with 11 .Rmd files containing the R Markdown scripts and explanations with hands-on material related to the concepts covered in the book. This repository is intended to be a companion for the book, but anyone with experience with predictive analytics and machine learning concepts can use this code independently. That is, the book is not required to follow the code, it just complements it.
The second folder contains the knitted version of the .Rmd files in PDF.
